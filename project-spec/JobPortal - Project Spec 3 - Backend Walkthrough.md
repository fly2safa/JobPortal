# Backend Walkthrough

The Job Portal backend should be built using Python 3.11+ and FastAPI, following a modular architecture. The folder structure and responsibilities are as follows:

	app/ – Root application folder. Contains all backend logic and modules.

		main.py – Entry point of the application, starts the FastAPI server.

		api/ – Defines versioned API endpoints.

			v1/routes/ – Route handlers for features like authentication, users, jobs, applications, recommendations, and AI assistant.

			dependencies.py – Common dependencies for routes (e.g., DB session, auth).

		core/ – Core app configuration and utilities.

			config.py – Environment and application configuration.

			security.py – Authentication, password hashing, JWT handling.

			logging.py – Structured logging setup.

			rate_limit.py – Rate limiting logic.

			errors.py – Centralized error handling.

		models/ – Database models using Pydantic + Beanie.

			Examples: user.py, company.py, job.py, application.py, resume.py, conversation.py.

		schemas/ – Request/response validation and serialization.

			Includes auth.py, user.py, job.py, application.py, resume.py, assistant.py, and common schemas.

		repositories/ – Encapsulates database operations for each model.

			Examples: user_repository.py, job_repository.py, application_repository.py, resume_repository.py.

		services/ – Business logic and domain services.

			Examples: authentication, resume parsing, search, recommendations, suggestions, email handling.

		ai/ – AI orchestration and workflows.

			providers/ – API clients for AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic).

			prompts/ – System prompts and templates for AI interactions.

			chains/ – LangChain prompt chains (recommendation, cover letter).

			rag/ – Retrieval-Augmented Generation: loader, splitter, embeddings, vectorstore, retriever, QA chain.

			agents/ –  Agent orchestration

			

		workers/ – Background processing.

			queue.py, scheduler.py – Task management and scheduling.

			tasks/ – Background tasks like embedding generation and email sending.



		db/ – Database setup and management.

			init_db.py – Async MongoDB connection and Beanie initialization.

			ndexes.py – Index definitions.

			migrations/ – Database migrations.
			
			

		utils/ – Shared utilities and adapters.

			Examples: pagination helpers, validators, adapters for integrations.
			
			
			
			

	Root files – Project-level configuration and dependencies.

		Dockerfile – Containerization setup.

		requirements.txt / pyproject.toml – Python dependencies.

		.env.example – Environment variables template.
