# Testing Tool v2.0.0 - MongoDB Database Integration

## Overview
This PR upgrades the Testing Tracker tool from v1.0.0 (file-based) to **v2.0.0 (database-integrated)**, enabling real-time team collaboration through MongoDB storage instead of local JSON files.

---

## What's New in v2.0.0

### MongoDB Integration
- **Real-time collaboration**: All test results stored in MongoDB
- **No more file conflicts**: Eliminates merge conflicts from JSON files
- **Centralized data**: Single source of truth for all team testing progress
- **API-driven**: Uses backend REST API for save/load operations

### Real vs Mockup Mode
- **Real Mode**: Saves to production `test_sessions` collection
- **Mockup Mode**: Saves to separate `test_sessions_mockup` collection for practice/training
- **Easy toggle**: Radio buttons at the top of the UI to switch modes

### New Backend Components
- **Models**: 
  - `TestSession` - Production test results
  - `TestSessionMockup` - Practice/training test results
- **API Routes**: 
  - `POST /api/v1/testing/sessions` - Save test session
  - `GET /api/v1/testing/sessions/latest` - Load latest session
  - `POST /api/v1/testing/mockup/sessions` - Save mockup session
  - `GET /api/v1/testing/mockup/sessions/latest` - Load latest mockup session
- **Database Registration**: Models registered in `init_db.py`
- **Router Integration**: Testing router included in `main.py`

### Updated GUI Features
- **Mode Selection**: Real/Mockup radio buttons in header
- **Database Actions**: 
  - "Load from Database" - Retrieves latest test session
  - "Save to Database" - Saves current progress to MongoDB
- **Backward Compatibility**: Still supports "Load File" and "Save File" for local backups
- **Smart Exit**: Prompts to save to database on exit
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for connection issues

## Removed Features
- Local `results/` folder workflow (no longer needed)
- Local `backup/` folder workflow (database serves as backup)
- File-based merge conflicts
- Manual file sharing via Dropbox/Google Drive

---

## New Dependencies
- `requests` library (for API calls from `test_tracker.py`)

---

## Technical Changes

### Backend Files Added/Modified:
```
✓ backend/app/models/test_result.py          # New: TestSession & TestSessionMockup models
✓ backend/app/api/v1/routes/testing.py       # New: Testing API endpoints
✓ backend/app/db/init_db.py                  # Modified: Register new models
✓ backend/app/main.py                        # Modified: Include testing router
```

### Testing Tool Files Modified:
```
✓ testing_tool/test_tracker.py               # Major refactor for DB integration
✓ testing_tool/README.md                     # Updated for v2.0.0 features
✓ testing_tool/TEAM_WORKFLOW.md              # Rewritten for DB-centric workflow
✓ testing_tool/VERSION_HISTORY.md            # Added v2.0.0 release notes
✓ testing_tool/.gitignore                    # Simplified (no results/backup folders)
```

### Files Deleted:
```
✗ testing_tool/results/.gitkeep              # No longer needed
✗ testing_tool/backup/.gitkeep               # No longer needed
```

## How It Works

### For Testers:
1. **Start Backend**: `python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload` (from `backend/` folder)
2. **Run Test Tracker**: `python test_tracker.py` (from `testing_tool/` folder)
3. **Select Mode**: Choose "Real" or "Mockup" at startup
4. **Enter Name & Browser**: Required before testing
5. **Load Progress**: Click "Load from Database" to retrieve latest session
6. **Test & Save**: Test features, click "Save to Database" to sync progress
7. **Exit**: Prompted to save to database on exit

### For Team Coordination:
- No more file sharing needed!
- All team members pull from the same database
- Real-time visibility of testing progress
- Coordinator can view/export consolidated results

## Testing Instructions

### Test in Mockup Mode First:
```powershell
# Terminal 1: Start backend
cd backend
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Terminal 2: Run test tracker
cd testing_tool
python test_tracker.py
```

1. Select **"Mockup"** mode
2. Enter your name and browser
3. Complete a few test cases
4. Click "Save to Database"
5. Close and reopen the app
6. Click "Load from Database" - your progress should be restored!

### Then Test Real Mode:
- Repeat the above steps with **"Real"** mode selected
- Verify data is saved to the production collection

## Database Collections

### Production:
- **Collection**: `test_sessions`
- **Purpose**: Actual testing progress for the project

### Mockup:
- **Collection**: `test_sessions_mockup`
- **Purpose**: Training/practice without affecting real data

## Migration Notes

### From v1.0.0 (File-based) to v2.0.0 (Database):
- Old JSON files in `results/` and `backup/` are no longer used
- Team members should transition to database workflow
- Old files can be kept for reference but won't be tracked in Git
- Use "Load File" feature if you need to import old test data

---

## Updated Documentation
- ✓ `testing_tool/README.md` - Installation, prerequisites, usage guide
- ✓ `testing_tool/TEAM_WORKFLOW.md` - Database-centric collaboration workflow
- ✓ `testing_tool/VERSION_HISTORY.md` - v2.0.0 release notes and breaking changes

---

## Bug Fixes
- ✓ Fixed `on_closing()` method to use database saving instead of file-based saving
- ✓ Removed old file-based logic from exit handler

---

## Breaking Changes
- **Requires Backend**: Test tracker now requires the backend server to be running
- **No Offline Mode**: Cannot test without MongoDB connection
- **File Workflow Deprecated**: Old file-based save/load is now secondary (backup only)

---

## Benefits
- ✓ **No more merge conflicts** on `TEAM_MASTER_test_results.json`
- ✓ **Real-time collaboration** - see team progress instantly
- ✓ **Centralized data** - single source of truth
- ✓ **Practice mode** - safe environment for learning the tool
- ✓ **Scalable** - works for teams of any size
- ✓ **Reliable** - MongoDB handles data integrity
