# TalentNest Testing Tracker - Version History

## How to Update the Version Number

The version number is defined in `test_tracker.py` as a class constant:

```python
class TestingTrackerApp:
    VERSION = "1.0.0"  # Update this line
```

### Version Numbering Convention (Semantic Versioning)

Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

- **MAJOR** (X.0.0): Breaking changes or major new features
  - Example: Complete UI redesign, database structure changes
  - Increment when: Changes that break backward compatibility
  
- **MINOR** (0.X.0): New features, backward compatible
  - Example: Adding new test sections, new export formats
  - Increment when: Adding functionality without breaking existing features
  
- **PATCH** (0.0.X): Bug fixes, small improvements
  - Example: Fixing save issues, UI tweaks, typo corrections
  - Increment when: Making bug fixes or minor improvements

### Examples

- `1.0.0` → `1.0.1`: Fixed a bug in save functionality
- `1.0.1` → `1.1.0`: Added new "Performance Testing" section
- `1.1.0` → `2.0.0`: Changed file format from JSON to SQLite (breaking change)

### Steps to Update Version

1. **Edit `test_tracker.py`:**
   ```python
   # Find this line (around line 58):
   VERSION = "1.0.0"
   
   # Change to new version:
   VERSION = "1.1.0"
   ```

2. **Update this file (`VERSION_HISTORY.md`):**
   - Add entry to the changelog below
   - Include date, version, and description of changes

3. **Commit the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add testing_tool/test_tracker.py testing_tool/VERSION_HISTORY.md
   git commit -m "chore: bump version to 1.1.0"
   ```
