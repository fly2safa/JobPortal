## Presentation Guidelines

### JobPortal Presentation: Presenter-Led Outline (20 min Presentation + 10 min Q&A)

---

### Section 1: Title Slide

**Topic:** Introduction

**Tips:**
- Start with your project title and a concise, one-sentence pitch.
- Introduce yourself and your team.

---

### Section 2: Agenda & Timeline

**Topic:** Setting Expectations

**Tips:**
- Confirm the 30-minute total slot:
  - 20 Minutes: Presentation
  - 10 Minutes: Q&A / Discussion
- Explain the 20-minute presentation flow:
  - First, we'll set the stage with the "Why" (The Opportunity).
  - Then, we'll spend ~10 minutes on the Live Demo.
  - After the demo, we'll unpack the "How" (architecture/AI), review costs, and share lessons learned.

---

### Section 3: The Opportunity (The "Why")

**Topic:** The core problem this project solves.

**Tips:**
- (Keep this brief, ~2-3 minutes)
- Focus on the pain points for both job seekers and employers.
- Use this to establish why a new, smarter solution is necessary.

---

### Section 4: The Solution: Live Demo

**Topic:** Live Application Walkthrough

**Tips:**
- (This is the main 10-minute segment)
- Transition: "Rather than just talk about it, let me show you how it works."
- Walk through the live demo, showing the end-to-end user journeys for both Seeker and Employer.
- Narrate the value as you click, pointing out where the AI is creating a better experience.

---

### Section 5: System Architecture & Data Model (The "How")

**Topic:** The technical foundation.

**Tips:**
- (This section can be 2-3 slides, one for each diagram)
- Now that they've seen the "what," show them the "how."
- Present your Frontend Architecture Diagram (e.g., component flow, state management).
- Showcase your Backend Architecture Diagram (e.g., API, services, DB communication).
- Display your ERD / MongoDB Schema Diagram (how the data is structured).
- Briefly explain how these systems worked together to power the demo.

---

### Section 6: The AI Engine (The "How" - Part 2)

**Topic:** How the "smart" features work.

**Tips:**
- Connect back to the demo.
- Briefly explain the AI processes seen in the demo (e.g., "When I uploaded the resume, this is the parsing that happened..." or "...the recommendations you saw were generated by this matching logic...").

---

### Section 7: Business & AI Cost Simulation

**Topic:** Operational Costs & Scaling Model

**Tips:**
- Break down costs into two buckets:
  - Fixed Costs: Platform fees (hosting, DB cluster, n8n plan).
  - Variable (Usage) Costs: This is all about AI tokens.
- Model your key AI "Transactions": Show the assumed token cost for a single action.
  - Example 1 (One-time): "1 Resume Parse" (using GPT-4o) = ~2,500 tokens = ~$0.02
  - Example 2 (Frequent): "1 AI Recommendation" (using GPT-4o) = ~1,200 tokens = ~$0.008
- Present a scaling simulation: Use those "per-action" costs to project a monthly bill as the user base grows. This demonstrates financial foresight.

**Example Simulation Table (for your slide):**

| User Base Tier       | Assumptions (per month)                   | Estimated Monthly AI Cost                                |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Launch (100 Users)   | 20 new seekers, 200 recommendations       | (20 * $0.02) + (200 * $0.008) ≈ **$2.00 / mo**          |
| Growth (1,000 Users) | 200 new seekers, 2,000 recommendations    | (200 * $0.02) + (2,000 * $0.008) ≈ **$20.00 / mo**      |
| Scale (10,000 Users) | 2,000 new seekers, 20,000 recommendations | (2,000 * $0.02) + (20,000 * $0.008) ≈ **$200.00 / mo**  |

> Note: These numbers are assumptions based on current pricing and estimated token counts. Clarify that this is a model, not a guarantee.

### Section 8: Our AI Cost-Control Strategy

**Topic:** Managing Scalability

**Tips:**
- This slide directly addresses the costs you just showed.
- Focus on the strategy (e.g., "process once, store forever," "cache results," "use tiered models," or open-source fallbacks for low-priority tasks).

---

### Section 9: Lessons Learned & Known Issues

**Topic:** Project Reflection

**Tips:**
- Share 1-2 key technical or workflow challenges you overcame.
- Be transparent about any outstanding bugs or limitations in the current demo.

---

### Section 10: Thank You & Discussion

**Topic:** Q&A

**Tips:**
- Keep this slide clean and simple.
- This signals the start of the 10-minute Q&A session.
- Close with: "Thank you. What questions do you have?"
